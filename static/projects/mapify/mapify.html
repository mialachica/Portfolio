    <span>

    <span>The different Featuregroups:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>All schools: Showcases all the schools that are on my list of attending. The colour of the tag depends on distance away from my home the school is. When you click on the tag it will showcase the distance and a google search of the school.
        </li>
        <li>Realistic Schools: Showcases the schools that are in range of my home making them a realistic distance and choice.</li>
        <li>Dream Schools: Showcases the schools in which are at a farther distance making it more expensive and a dream idea to attend.</li>
        <li>Radii for Living Situation: Creates two different circles for where I would need a dorm or I could live at home.
